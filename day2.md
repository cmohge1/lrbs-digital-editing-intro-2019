### Editing the Classics (Simona Stoyanova)

### What is Documentary Editing?

> Like all diplomatic transcription except type facsimile, plain text does not reproduce, simulate, or report the original lineation, pagination, or any other formal aspect of the manuscript, save where the writer intended it to bear meaning and that meaning is transcribable—which is exactly why it does reproduce or simulate many formal elements, such as various kinds of indention and purposeful lineation.

<details><summary>Lecture Notes</summary>
<ul>
<li><p>To make a long article short: transcribe as much as possible in a documentary edition.</p></li>

<li><p>The old divide between literary and historical editing. Historical: more about annotation (contextual commentary). Literary: more about textual variants.</p></li>

<li><p>Naive view: literary editing produces eclectic texts, historical editors produce "faithful" texts.</p></li>

<li><p>Literalness and exactness and critical. Faithfulness?</p></li>

<li><p>Modernisation and regularisation. What is lost by the editor imposing regularity and spelling changes on a historical or private document.</p></li>

<li><p>Jefferson "wd hve retird immedly hd h. nt bn infmd". What is lost by expanding the abbreviations?</p></li>

<li><p>Felicity to the document or to the reader?</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Type facsimile:</strong> either a photographic reproduction or near approximation of every physical feature of a document.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Diplomatic:</strong> "wd hve retird immedly hd h. nt bn infmd";</p>
<p><strong>Semi-diplomatic:</strong> "w[oul]d h[a]ve retir[e]d immed[iate]ly h[a]d h[e] n[o]t b[ee]n inf[or]m[e]d";</p>
<p><strong>Clear text:</strong> would have retired immediately had he not been informed.</p></li>

<li><p>Yet another option, which is one of the most pragmatic, is <strong>plain text</strong>, which was conceived by the editors of the Mark Twain Project's letters edition:
'when the documents originally sent are intact and available, we transcribe them as fully and precisely as is compatible with a highly inclusive critical text—not a literal or all-inclusive one, but a typographical transcription that is optimally legible and, at the same time, maximally faithful to the text that Clemens himself transmitted.1 Original documents are therefore emended (changed) as little as possible, which means only in order to alter, simplify, or omit what would otherwise threaten to make the transcription unreadable, or less than fully intelligible in its own right. When, however, the original documents are lost or unavailable, we necessarily rely on the most authoritative available copy of them. Since copies by their nature contain errors, nonoriginal documents are emended as much as necessary, partly for the reasons we emend originals, but chiefly to restore the text of the lost original, insofar as the evidence permits.'</p></li>

<li><p>Yet: one cannot transcribe everything. As soon as transcription happens, an element of contingency comes into the text. It is still a representation.</p></li>
