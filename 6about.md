### Convened by: Dr Christopher Ohge

### Guest tutors: Simona Stoyanova (Institute of Classical Studies, LatinNow Project), Jonathan Blaney (Institute for Historical Research), Jessica Dalton (St Andrews)

**Venue: Senate House, University of London**

This course will survey the traditions and principles of scholarly editing and textual scholarship, complemented with training on the fundamentals of creating digital editions. It aims to provide an understanding of the history of editorial practice, including the study of manuscripts, the theory of copy text editing, and the decisions relating to textual and contextual apparatus that inform the design of an edition. Students will focus on encoding documents in XML using the standards of the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI). Students will also learn about Markdown, HTML, CSS, alternative markup languages (such as LMNL), and how to incorporate digital facsimiles into editions using the TextLab editing tool. Students will also have the opportunity to examine rare books and manuscripts in the Senate House Library’s Special Collections.

Please note: No prior experience with programming is required. If you have experience with TEI-XML, you may want to consider taking the [Digital Scholarly Editing: Advanced Methods module, which runs from 1–5 July 2019](https://bit.ly/lrbs-editing-adv).
